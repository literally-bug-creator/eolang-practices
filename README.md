## 📖 About EO Language

EO is an experimental object-oriented programming language that aims to provide a formal mathematical foundation for OOP through φ-calculus. Unlike traditional OO languages, EO is based on pure object composition without classes, inheritance, or typical OOP constructs.

### Key Features:
- Pure object-oriented approach
- Based on φ-calculus mathematical foundation
- No classes or inheritance
- Everything is an object
- Functional programming elements
